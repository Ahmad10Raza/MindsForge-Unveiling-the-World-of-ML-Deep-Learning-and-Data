### **Objective Statement:**

> To build a custom AI-powered document understanding system using the `donut-base or LLM` model that can automatically extract structured keywords (e.g., invoice number, date, vendor, amount) from unstructured **English invoice documents** (both scanned and text PDFs), and return the extracted information in a clean  **JSON format** , without relying on OCR engines.

#### **Key Goals:**

1. âœ… **Train a layout-aware model** on a custom dataset of English invoices using the `donut-base` or `LLM` model.
2. âœ… **Enable support for both scanned and text-based PDFs** by converting them into images and leveraging Donutâ€™s vision-text transformer architecture.
3. âœ… **Eliminate the need for OCR** by using Donutâ€™s image-to-sequence prediction capability.
4. âœ… **Automatically extract relevant invoice fields** like:
   * Invoice Number
   * Invoice Date
   * Vendor Name
   * Total Amount
   * Payment Due Date (if applicable)
5. âœ… **Generate structured outputs** in machine-readable JSON format.
6. âœ… **Build an inference pipeline or deploy as an API** for integration into downstream systems (e.g., ERP, finance automation).

#### ðŸ“Œ **Why This Project Matters**

* Traditional OCR systems fail or require heavy template engineering when dealing with varied invoice formats.
* Many invoices have  **non-standard layouts** , especially when scanned.
* This approach uses a **generalizable, layout-aware, OCR-free** transformer that can be fine-tuned on your domain-specific data for high accuracy.
