YOLO (You Only Look Once) is one of the most popular  **object detection algorithms** . It treats object detection as a  **single regression problem** , directly predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities from an input image in one forward pass of a neural network, making it  **extremely fast and real-time capable** .

Let‚Äôs break it down step by step:

---

## 1. What is YOLO?

* YOLO is an **object detection algorithm** that detects multiple objects in an image or video in real time.
* Unlike older approaches (e.g., R-CNN, Fast R-CNN) which use  **region proposals + classification** , YOLO applies a **single CNN network** over the image to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities at once.
* This makes YOLO **fast (real-time)** but sometimes less accurate for detecting small objects compared to region-based methods.

---

## 2. Working of YOLO

1. Input image is divided into an **S √ó S grid** (e.g., 7√ó7).
2. Each grid cell predicts:
   * **Bounding boxes** (coordinates + confidence score).
   * **Class probabilities** for objects.
3. The network outputs a tensor combining bounding boxes and probabilities.
4. After predictions, **post-processing** (like Non-Maximum Suppression) removes duplicate/overlapping boxes.

---

## 3. Key Terms in YOLO

### a) **Bounding Box**

* A rectangle around an object.
* Defined by:
  * **x, y** ‚Üí center of the box (relative to grid cell).
  * **w, h** ‚Üí width and height (relative to image dimensions).
  * **Confidence score** ‚Üí probability that the box contains an object.

---

### b) **Grid Cell**

* The image is split into S√óS grid cells.
* Each cell is responsible for detecting objects whose **center** falls inside it.
* Example: If S = 7, then the image is split into 49 cells.

---

### c) **Confidence Score**

* Indicates how confident the model is that a bounding box contains an object.
* Formula:

  `Confidence = P(Object) √ó IoU(predicted_box, ground_truth_box)`

  * `P(Object)` = probability that an object is present.
  * `IoU` = how much predicted box overlaps with ground truth.

---

### d) **Class Probability**

* For each grid cell, YOLO predicts probabilities for each class (e.g., dog, cat, car).
* Example: If there are 20 classes, each grid cell predicts 20 probabilities.

---

### e) **Intersection over Union (IoU)**

* A metric to evaluate object detection performance.
* Measures overlap between **predicted bounding box** and  **ground truth bounding box** .
* Formula:

  `IoU = Area of Overlap / Area of Union`
* IoU > 0.5 (commonly) ‚Üí detection is considered correct.

---

### f) **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**

* Used to remove duplicate boxes around the same object.
* Steps:
  1. Pick the box with the  **highest confidence** .
  2. Remove boxes with **IoU above a threshold** (e.g., 0.5).
  3. Repeat until no boxes remain.

---

### g) **Anchor Boxes**

* Predefined bounding boxes of different shapes and sizes used to detect multiple objects of varying scales in the same grid cell.
* Helps YOLO detect multiple objects in one cell (introduced in YOLOv2).

---

### h) **Feature Map**

* After passing the image through CNN, YOLO produces a feature map (e.g., 13√ó13).
* Each cell in this feature map corresponds to a grid cell in the image, carrying information about objects.

---

### i) **Loss Function in YOLO**

YOLO‚Äôs loss combines 3 parts:

1. **Localization Loss** ‚Üí error in predicted bounding box coordinates (x, y, w, h).
2. **Confidence Loss** ‚Üí error in objectness score.
3. **Classification Loss** ‚Üí error in predicted class probabilities.

---

## 4. YOLO Versions (Evolution)

1. **YOLOv1 (2016)** ‚Üí Grid-based prediction, struggles with small objects.
2. **YOLOv2 (YOLO9000)** ‚Üí Introduced anchor boxes, batch norm, better accuracy.
3. **YOLOv3** ‚Üí Multi-scale prediction, residual connections, Darknet-53 backbone.
4. **YOLOv4** ‚Üí Improved speed and accuracy using Bag of Freebies (BoF) and Bag of Specials (BoS).
5. **YOLOv5** (by Ultralytics) ‚Üí PyTorch implementation, lightweight and fast.
6. **YOLOv7** ‚Üí State-of-the-art (2022), better real-time performance.
7. **YOLOv8** ‚Üí Latest (2023, Ultralytics), more modular, supports detection, segmentation, classification.
